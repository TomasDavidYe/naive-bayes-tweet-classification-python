# About
As a member of a small university team, I analyzed vast amounts of twitter feed data and tried to answer the question: â€œHow does the Czech public view nuclear energy?". 
The idea was to provide this answer by analysing a dataset of internet posts extracted from the Czech internet via NLP methods.

In this repository, the code implementing a Naive Bayes predictor of post relevance can be found.
